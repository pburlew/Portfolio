# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This is a Portfolio I created using Bootstrap framework. The pages are based on the bootstrap grid layout and designed to be responsive on different browser sizes. 

Creating the grid on the portfolio page was the most challenging and I had difficulty aligning the correct photo sizes initially. The more that I simplified my code down, the more successful I was with the layouts I was achieving. 

I also added features like a navbar, responsive images, and responsive layout. I used clean, semantic HTML to make the code as clear as possible.
